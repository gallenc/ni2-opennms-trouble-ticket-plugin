=== Introduction to the {plugin-product-name}

The {plugin-product-name} is an open source OSGi plugin which integrates OpenNMS with the Ni2 Trouble Ticketing Engine.

Ni2 provides a ReST api which the plugin uses to create and update tickets.

OSGi is a standard mechanism which OpenNMS uses to allow 'plugins' to be deployed and add functionality to a standard OpenNMS release.

The plugin is provided as a karaf .kar file (a kind of zip file) which is placed in the OpenNMS deploy directory. 
The corresponding configuration files for the plugin are placed in the OpenNMS etc directory.
A full description of the installation and configuration options are provided later in this guide.

When the ticketing plugin is correctly installed and configured, additional options to manually create, update and close tickets are provided on the Alarm UI.
Automated creation of tickets for new alarms is also possible and this is covered in the configuration section.

=== Manually creating a ticket

All current alarms are visible in the Alarms page of OpenNMS.

Selecting the ID of an alarm will take you to the alarm details page for that alarm.
A new alarm with no associate ticket is illustrated below

When the `Create Ticket` button is pressed, the ticket state changes to `CREATE_PENDING`, and if the create is successful, refreshing the alarm page will show the ticket as OPEN and a new reference link to the ticket will also be created.
Selecting this link will take you to the corresponding page for the ticket created in Ni2.

If the create was not successful, a `CREATE_FAILED` message will appear. 
This can happen if the ReST API credentials are not set properly or if the Node Name associated with the alarm is not known as a resource id in the Ni2 system.
The configuration section will talk more about troubleshooting ticket creation issues.

The Update Ticket button requests the current state of an associated ticket in Ni2 (without changing its state).

The `Close Ticket` button can only be pressed if the associated alarm is already `CLEARED`. 
It sets the state of the ticket in Ni2 to `RESOLVED` (Although this is reflected on the OpenNNS UI as `CLOSED`)

=== Ticket Lifecycle

OpenNMS has a very simple lifecycle for tickets.

Tickets associated with alarms can be in one of the following states: `OPEN, CANCELLED, CLOSED`. Alarms will only be deleted if the associated tickets are `CANCELLED` or `CLOSED`.

Ni2 has a richer lifecycle illustrated below

The mapping between Ni2 tickets and OpenNMS ticket states is as follows

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Ni2 Ticket Status |OpenNMS Ticket Status

|IN_PROCESS
|OPEN

|OPEN
|OPEN

|CLOSED
|CLOSED

|CANCELLED
|CANCELLED

|RESOLVED
|CLOSED

|any other Ni2 State
|OPEN
|===


The ticket state shown on the alarm UI reflects the current state of the Ni2 ticket and can be updated using the `Update` button.
OpenNMS can request the creation of new tickets but it can only set tickets into the resolved state if they have been set to the `IN_PROCESS` state by an Ni2 operator.
